# My Journey into NLP with Deep Learning

Hello everyone!

This repo is for a personal project in which I intend to report my path to learn Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Deep Learning.

## When and where I started

## Diary

- 21/12/2020 to 04/12/2020 - 
In the last two weeks, I finished watching the first lecture of Stanford CS224N - NLP with Deep Learning - Winter 2019, which I had started the week before.
Although it was a good lecture, I found it hard to follow the math of the main topic: Word2Vec.
Therefore, I decided to rewatch Andrew Ng's videos on the subject, which are available on [his Sequence Models course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models/home/week/2).
Andrew's videos on the subject are easier to understand and directly cite the related papers, which I found extremely helpful.
I also decided to read some online hands-on tutorials.
The [Pierre Megret tutorial on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pierremegret/gensim-word2vec-tutorial) was very helpful to comprehend the gensim library, while [Ivan Chen's Medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/word2vec-from-scratch-with-numpy-8786ddd49e72) was very handy to get a more in-depth and low-level understanding of the Word2Vec.
However, I missed a tutorial on the subject using PyTorch.
I hope to find a good one next week or create one of my own.
Finally, I would like to mention that I finished the CS224 first assignment, and it was quite interesting and easy to follow.
Now I expect to go faster on my studies because the last two weeks were not very productive.
